# How Did I Get Here?
In the Spring of 2020 I was working in the curatorial office of a beloved art museum and by the end of the year I was gearing up to embark on a new journey as a junior developer at a fast-growing startup. The onset of a global pandemic presented me with an unexpected opportunity to pivot, leading me to plunge headfirst into the realm of programming. I enrolled in a rigorous full stack coding bootcamp and graduated with my first job offers already in hand. Since then, I've accumulated substantial on-the-job experience in both frontend and backend development, with a primary focus on JavaScript frameworks, APIs, and cloud services. These skills have been complemented by the foundational knowledge I acquired during my bootcamp training.

My diverse professional background spans project management, library and information science (across public, academic, and archival sectors), film production, grant writing, and publishing, with a strong emphasis on non-profit work. This breadth of experience has shaped my holistic perspective on problem-solving and has honed my adaptability in diverse environments. I take pride in my flexibility, my insatiable appetite for learning, and my unwavering enthusiasm for new challenges. I especially thrive when collaborating on creative solutions with other curious minds.

I love hearing about new opportunities so don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:Jordan.S.Spencer@gmail.com).
